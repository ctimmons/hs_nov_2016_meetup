### How Laziness Affects Correctness

#### Pure, Non-I/O Code

The good news is that laziness does not affect the correctness of pure code.  This was one of the points of Hughes' paper.

#### I/O Code

The bad news is that laziness can affect the correctness of I/O code.

Because the order of lazy computations is not guaranteed, monads were created to impose an order of execution.  However, the IO monad does not impose any strictness.

There are three kinds of I/O in Haskell:

- Imperative (handle-based)
- Lazy
- Iteratee

|                                    | Handle-based I/O | Lazy I/O  | Iteratee I/O |
| -------------                      |:-------------:| :-----:| :-----:|
| Processing                         | Strict and incremental | Lazy | Strict and incremental |
| What drives evaluation?            | Looping code | Stream consumer | Enumerator and iterator |
| Level of abstraction | Low         | High | High |
| Composability | Low         | ? | High |
| Resource management and exceptions | Precise control | No precise control | Precise control |
| Third-party dependencies           | No | No | Yes |

None of the three kinds of I/O are necessarily "good" or "bad" - it depends on what your requirements are.
