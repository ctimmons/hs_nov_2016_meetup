# DON'T PANIC!

- Haskell's laziness can make everything seem backwards
  - Difficult tasks can sometimes be made easier or more efficient, but...
  - Easy tasks can become more complex and harder to reason about
- The good news is software development fundamentals don't change because of laziness.
  - Correctness first.  Use laziness to your advantage by using equational reasoning, libraries, and lazy-friendly algorithms (i.e. write Haskell, not Fortran)
  - Optimize second.  Use tools to find out if and where lazy code needs to be made strict.

In practice, it seems laziness isn't a major help or hinderance - it just is.

### Cost/Benefit Analysis

Haskell's main features are

- Pure
- Clear distinction between pure and impure (I/O) code
- Immutable
- Strong type system
- Higher-order functions (HOF)
- Laziness

Laziness is the odd one.  The other features have few, if any, drawbacks, plus they're all enforced by the compiler.  Whereas laziness is a double-edged sword, and not enforced by the compiler.

Taming laziness requires using tools and developing some intuition.
