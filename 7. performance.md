### How Laziness Affects Performance

There is no free lunch.

Regardless of the programming language, both laziness and strictness have a cost.

In Haskell, laziness can result in "space leaks", a situation where unevaluated thunks accumuluate in memory, possibly crashing the program. (e.g. foldl (+) 0 [1..100000000])

Too much strictness can cause values to be evaluated unnecessarily, wasting time and maybe memory, too.
