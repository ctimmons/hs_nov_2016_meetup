### Why is Haskell Lazy?

The paper [Why Functional Programming Matters, by John Hughes](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf), and the design of Haskell, both occurred in the late 1980s.

According to the [History of Haskell](http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/history.pdf), the designers were influenced by Hughes' paper.  They also wanted a pure language, which apparently is much easier to design if the language has non-strict semantics.

From section 3.2:

> Once we were committed to a lazy language, a pure one was inescapable.

> ...perhaps the biggest single benefit of laziness is not laziness per se,
> but rather that laziness kept us pure, and thereby motivated a great deal of productive work on monads and encapsulated state.

(My opinion): Another possible factor is the state of microcomputer architectures at that time.  An 80386 running at 20 Mhz with less than 1MB RAM was common.  Lazy evaluation may have seemed like a viable solution for better performing compilers on such limited hardware.

#### Good or Bad?

It depends.

Lazy evaluation isn't a panacea.  Used properly, it offers great reductions in CPU cycles, while usually using more memory.  Altering an algorithm to strike a balance between speed and memory can make the code more complex.

Use improperly, laziness can result in a "space leak", where exorbitant amounts of memory are used, causing a program to perform poorly, or even crash.
