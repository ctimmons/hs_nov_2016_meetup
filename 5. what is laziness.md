### What is Laziness?

- Non-strict semantics is the technical term.  Laziness is the implementation technique.
- Laziness is present is almost every mainstream programming language
  - Boolean short-circuit evaluation in pretty much every language (COBOL too!)
  - Generators (Python, Ruby, PHP, .Net, some RDBMS's)
  - Lazy monad-like things (.Net's LINQ)
  - Lazy data types (.Net, OCaml)
- Everything in Haskell is lazy, including the type system
- Laziness does *not* mean asynchronous
  - Asynchronous means starting execution, but not knowing when - or even if - the operation will finish
  - Laziness means execution will only occur if the runtime determines the results of that operation are needed
  - These can be mixed (i.e. lazy asynchronous ops), but they are two different things

|               | Synchronous | Asynchronous |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|
| **Strict**   | Strict and Synchronous | Strict and Asynchronous |
| **Lazy**     | Lazy and Synchronous | Lazy and Asynchronous |


#### Evaluation

- An unevaluated value is called a "thunk" (a future promise of a computation)
- A partially evaluated value is said to be in "weak head normal form" (WHNF)
- A fully evaluated value is said to be in "normal form" (NF)
- Example: let xs = map (+1) [1..10] :: [Int]
- Making lazy computations strict
  - seq and $! for WHNF
  - evaluate for WHNF (from Control.Exception, used for checking for exceptions in lazy data structures)
  - force, deepseq and $!! for NF (from Control.DeepSeq)
  - sequence and sequence_ for NF in monads
  - Strictness flags (!) in data constructors (Haskell language spec.)
  - "Bang" patterns (also !) in pattern matching (GHC extension)
